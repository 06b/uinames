This is the repo for [uinames.com](http://uinames.com). Feel free to contribute to the project by adding names. Keep in mind that more isn't better. Quality over quantity. Quality being the most common/popular names in a country.

_Example: listed for the United States are 100 male names, 100 female names and 300 last names. That's 60.000 possible combinations. The sources of names and surnames are [ssa.gov](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/century.html) and [mongabay.com](http://names.mongabay.com/data/1000.html) respectively._
